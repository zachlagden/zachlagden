An enthusiastic full-stack developer based in Ascot, UK. In addition to my role as a developer, I also serve as a code coach at Jam Coding where I help to provide better coding education for the younger generation.

ðŸ”­ Currently working on: Inspiring young minds through coding lessons for primary school students.

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Continuously seeking opportunities to broaden my expertise in programming and education, I am currently focused on mastering C# as part of my ongoing learning journey.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Coding, teaching strategies, or anything related to science and programming!

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachlagden/).

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or teaching, you can find me enjoying a round of golf or diving into my favorite music genres.

Let's collaborate and create something amazing! ðŸš€
